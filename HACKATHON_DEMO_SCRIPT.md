# 🏆 betterSearch Hackathon Demo Script
## Gemini 3 + Graphon AI Hackathon

---

## 🎯 **DEMO THEME: "From Zero to Knowledge Mastery in 7 Minutes"**

**Hook**: "What if you could upload 1000 pages of research papers, hours of lecture videos, and PDF textbooks—then ask questions and get answers with exact citations? That's what we built."

---

## 📋 **DEMO FLOW (7 Minutes Total)**

### **1. OPENING (30 seconds) - "The Problem"**
**Say:**
> "Students and researchers are drowning in information. You have lecture videos, research papers, PDFs, textbooks—but no way to actually search and reason across them all. We built betterSearch: a multimodal AI knowledge base that combines Gemini 3's native multimodality with Graphon AI's trillion-token knowledge graphs."

**Visual**: Show empty interface, then demonstrate the problem with stacked documents.

---

### **2. MULTIMODAL UPLOAD (1 minute) - Graphon Track Highlight 🧠**

**Say:**
> "First, let's build your knowledge graph. Watch this—we're uploading multiple file types simultaneously: PDFs, videos, images. This is powered by Graphon AI's cross-modal architecture."

**DO:**
1. Click "Upload to Knowledge Graph" (or paperclip icon)
2. Select multiple files:
   - 2-3 PDF research papers (100+ pages total)
   - 1 lecture video (if available)
   - Screenshots/images with diagrams
3. Show the upload progress
4. **Highlight**: "Graphon is building a relationship graph across all these modalities in real-time"

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **Graphon Track Prize**: Emphasize this is exactly the "best multimodal search tool"
- ✅ Show cross-modal indexing (video timestamps, PDF pages, image extraction)
- ✅ Mention: "This runs securely, with persistent memory that never runs out of space"

---

### **3. NATIVE MULTIMODAL QUERY (1.5 minutes) - Gemini 3 Power 🔹**

**Say:**
> "Now the magic. Gemini 3 was trained natively on text, images, audio, and video together. So when I ask a question, it reasons across ALL my sources simultaneously."

**DO:**
1. Enable "Knowledge Graph Mode" (toggle in settings/command palette)
2. Ask a complex question that requires cross-modal reasoning:
   - Example: *"Based on the lecture video and the research paper, explain how transformer attention works and show me the relevant diagrams"*
3. Show the answer streaming in
4. **Highlight the citations**:
   - 🎥 Video: "Lecture 3, 12:34-15:20"
   - 📄 PDF: "Attention Paper, Page 47"
   - 🖼️ Image: "Diagram from Slide 12"

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Native multimodality (not just RAG stitching)
- ✅ Citations with exact timestamps/page numbers
- ✅ Cross-modal reasoning (video + paper + diagrams together)

---

### **4. LONG-CONTEXT DEMONSTRATION (1 minute) - 1M Token Context 🔹**

**Say:**
> "Gemini 3 has 1M token context—that's ~700K words. We're putting that to work. Let me show you what happens when you've ingested your entire course."

**DO:**
1. Show the "Neural Archives" (Notes modal)
2. Show accumulated notes/syllabus generated from the knowledge base
3. Demonstrate a query that requires reasoning across the entire corpus:
   - Example: *"Compare the approaches to neural networks across all three papers I uploaded"*
4. Show how it synthesizes from multiple long documents

**Key Points:**
- ✅ 1M token context = entire codebases/weeks of lectures
- ✅ Persistent memory via Graphon (trillion-token capability)
- ✅ Research/legal/finance use case

---

### **5. GENERATIVE UI & VISUALIZATION (1.5 minutes) - Gemini 3 Feature 🔹**

**Say:**
> "Gemini 3 doesn't just answer—it generates complete interactive visualizations. Watch this."

**DO:**
1. Ask: *"Visualize the architecture of the neural network from the paper"*
2. Show Mermaid diagram auto-generating
3. Click to open full-screen SVG modal
4. Ask: *"Create a flowchart of the research methodology"*
5. Show another diagram generating

**Bonus - Generative Assessment:**
1. Open Syllabus modal
2. Click on a topic
3. Click "Generate Assessment"
4. Show AI-generated MCQ quiz appearing

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Generative UI (not just text responses)
- ✅ Interactive visualizations (Mermaid + SVG)
- ✅ Educational simulations (assessments)

---

### **6. RESEARCH AGENT - Multi-Step Reasoning (1 minute) 🔹**

**Say:**
> "For complex questions, we deploy a research agent that orchestrates multiple tools: web search, knowledge graph queries, and synthesis."

**DO:**
1. Enable "Deep Research" mode (or show command palette option)
2. Ask a question requiring external + internal knowledge:
   - Example: *"What's the latest research on attention mechanisms, and how does it compare to what's in my uploaded papers?"*
3. Show the agent planning steps:
   - Step 1: "Searching web for latest research..."
   - Step 2: "Querying knowledge graph for internal papers..."
   - Step 3: "Synthesizing findings..."
4. Show the final comprehensive answer

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ Tool integration (web + graphon)
- ✅ Reasoning workflows

---

### **7. SOCRATIC MODE - Unique Feature (30 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "And here's something unique: Socratic Mode. Instead of giving answers, the AI guides you through questioning. Perfect for deep learning."

**DO:**
1. Switch to Socratic Mode (toggle `?`)
2. Ask: *"How does backpropagation work?"*
3. Show how it asks questions back instead of answering directly
4. Mention: "This forces you to reason, not just consume"

---

### **8. CLOSING (30 seconds) - "What We Built"**

**Say:**
> "We've combined:
> - **Gemini 3's native multimodality** for cross-modal reasoning
> - **1M token context** for entire knowledge bases
> - **Generative UI** for visualizations and assessments
> - **Graphon AI** for persistent, trillion-token knowledge graphs
> - **Research agents** for multi-step reasoning
> 
> This couldn't have existed six months ago. It's the future of research and education."
