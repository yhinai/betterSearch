## 🔑 **KEY PHRASES TO SAY**

### **When Uploading:**
> "Graphon is building a relationship graph across all modalities in real-time"

### **When Querying:**
> "Notice how Gemini 3 reasons natively across video, PDF, and images simultaneously—this is native multimodality"

### **When Showing Citations:**
> "Exact citations with timestamps and page numbers—cross-modal search in action"

### **When Generating Visualization:**
> "Gemini 3 generates complete interactive visualizations, not just text—this is generative UI"

### **When Research Agent Runs:**
> "Multi-agent orchestration: web search, knowledge graph, and synthesis working together"

### **Closing:**
> "This combines Gemini 3's native multimodality, 1M token context, and Graphon's trillion-token knowledge graphs. This couldn't have existed six months ago."

## 🎤 **ELEVATOR PITCH (30 SEC)**

> "We built betterSearch: Gemini 3's native multimodality + Graphon's trillion-token knowledge graphs. Upload thousands of pages, hours of video—get answers with exact citations, interactive visualizations, and personalized assessments. This couldn't exist six months ago."

---

## ⚠️ **IF SOMETHING BREAKS**

- **Graphon fails?** → "Let me show you the local knowledge base mode with notes"
- **Upload slow?** → "Normally this takes 30 seconds, but we've pre-loaded for demo"
- **No visualization?** → "Let me show a pre-generated example" (have backup)
- **API error?** → "The architecture supports this—this is just a connectivity issue"

---

## ✅ **LAST-MINUTE CHECKS**

1. Backend running? (`python backend/server.py`)
2. Frontend running? (`npm run dev`)
3. Files pre-uploaded?
4. Example queries ready?
5. Screen/microphone working?

## 🎯 **TOP 3 THINGS TO EMPHASIZE**

1. **"Native Multimodality"** - Not RAG stitching, true cross-modal reasoning
2. **"Graphon Integration"** - Trillion-token knowledge graphs
3. **"Generative UI"** - Interactive visualizations and assessments
